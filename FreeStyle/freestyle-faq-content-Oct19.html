    <h4 class="sub-sect-header">Replacements</h4>
    
    <p>We make every effort to ship quickly and accurately.  If we make an error we strive to ship replacements within 7 business days from art approval.</p>
    
    
    <h4 class="sub-sect-header">Artwork</h4>
    
    <p><b>How to submit:</b> For quickest and most economical order process, please submit artwork in vector format. We accept either .eps, pdf, or .ai files.   Files submitted in this format must be of proper resolution and true vector artwork or they will need to be resent or redrawn.  All other file types can be redrawn but will not be exact match and will extend lead-time.</p>
    
    <p><b>Art approval:</b> Art approval is your sign off on the artwork, sizes, quantities, and roster telling us to proceed with an order you have already placed.  We do everything possible to ensure order accuracy, but ultimately need your final sign off to produce the garment accurately.  It is critical to give the art approval process a thorough review. <u>Lead times do not start until you have provided approval on the artwork, roster, and all relevant order information.</u></p>
    
    <p><b>Roster approval:</b> It is important to preview each image during roster entry to ensure that the selections render correctly. This step allows the opportunity to go back and make changes to the design prior to order submission.  The customer is responsible for proofing and approving all names and numbers. Utilize our online roster form for ease of submission. Please follow roster instructions to ensure correct information is applied to your order.</p>
    
    <p><b>Mock ups:</b> Mock-ups are requests for artwork without supplying an order.  Augusta Sportswear Brands offers free custom mock-ups and logo redraws. In the rare instance that art requires over 3 hours to complete and is not accompanied with an order, you will be charged an additional charge for the time.  We will request your approval to move forward before proceeding with the charges. In these instances when you pay for a mock up and come back to place your order we will not charge the custom art fee associated with that order. If you place an order from a mock-up you will still receive the final art with your roster to approve.</p>
    
    <p><b>Custom fonts:</b> Augusta Sportswear brands will accept custom font orders if the live format of the custom font is provided. The order will be considered full custom and longer lead times apply. See details above. Additionally, a per unit upcharge of $6 MSRP will be applied for up to 50 units. Augusta Sportswear pattern fills can be added to both standard and custom fonts.  If the garment design uses a standard font and pattern fills are applied, the order will be considered full custom with longer lead times and the $6 MSPR per unit upcharge. If the garment design uses a custom font and pattern fills are applied, garments will only be upcharged $6 MSRP per unit once. Custom fonts or adding a pattern fills to fonts require additional time for large orders. Please add 5 additional days on orders over 75 pieces.</p>

    <h4 class="sub-sect-header">Color</h4>
    
    <p>Augusta Sportswear offers a robust color pallet to cover any need.  Colors are intended to match each of our brands stock color standards.   These colors are calibrated regularly on all equipment.   Despite all efforts to perfectly match the color standard, it is impossible to guarantee an exact match from order to order.</p>
    
    <p>Online designs feature RGB values which can vary from one monitor to another. In production, the RGB values are converted to CMYK values for printing.  Augusta Sportswear Brands will not be responsible for color variations between online previews and production garments.</p>
    
    <p><b>PMS Color Matching</b></p>
    
    <p>We offer PMS color matching as a service.   We are unable to guarantee an exact color match, but will utilize a detailed process to ensure the closest match possible.  We charge $100.00 MSRP per color to be matched. These orders will require additional lead time to match the color.  Please add 5 days to your lead time if you have less than 5 PMS color matches.  Please add 10 days if you have 5 or more PMS color matches.   Rush service is not available on these orders.</p>
    
    <p>Reorders requiring a PMS color match will not receive a charge, but will require the additional lead time stated above.</p>
    
    <p>We are unable to PMS color match on Russell Athletic styles.</p>
    
    <p><b>Sublimated reversible garments</b> are a great product to purchase two jerseys for the price of one.  Please know that when very light and very dark colors are printed on reverse sides the darker color will show through the light color and will cause colors to be slightly off standard.</p>

When pilling occurs the white body fabric can become visible. Below is a list of Sublimation “Do’s and Don’ts”. Following these care instructions will be crucial to the long life of your sublimated garment.</p>
