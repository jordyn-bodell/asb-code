		 <h3>Glossary</h3>
		 
		 	<p><b style="font-size:18px;">Decorating Terms</b> <br><br>
<b>APPLIQUÉ</b>: The process of stitching decoration or trimming, cut from one fabric piece, to another, to add dimension. 
<br><br>
<b>EMBROIDERY</b>: The process of decorating by using a special machine that is programmed to stitch a design combining texture, pattern and color. Holloway can match thread colors for any embroidery to your logo or artwork.
<br><br>
<b>JERSEY APPLIQUÉ</b>: The process of specifically stitching decoration or trimming, cut from Jersey Knit fabric, to another, adding dimension.
<br><br>
<b>LASER ETCH</b>: A process that uses laser technology to etch or burn a mark on a fabric surface. Holloway can apply Laser Etching on any polyester fabric and it looks great on mid-tone colors.
<br><br>
<b>MULTIMEDIA</b>: The process of applying two or more of the techniques by layering them on a single garment. This technique is a great way to create truly one-of-a-kind looks.
<br><br>
<b>REVERSE LASER APPLIQUÉ</b>: The process of using a laser beam to cut single or multiple fabric layers of fabric, revealing a fine, detailed design. Reverse Laser Appliqué is a great technique to add texture to Holloway sweatshirts.
<br><br>
<b>SCREEN PRINT</b>: The process of creating a printed design by squeezing ink through screens and allowing color to pass through open areas. Multi-colored designs are achieved using one screen for each color in the design.  
<br><br>
<!-- <b>Premium Transfer/Heat Transfer</b>: 
<br></br>
<b>Sim Stitch Transfer</b>: 
<br></br> -->
<b style="font-size:18px;">Embroidery Terms</b> <br><br>
<b>BACKING</b>: Material used beneath the embroidered fabric to provide stability and support.
<br><br>
<b>DIGITIZING</b>: The process of converting artwork or logos into a series of stitch commands read by an embroidery machine’s computer.
<br><br>
<b>EMBLEM/PATCH</b>: An embroidered design with a finished edge, stitched independent of a garment.
<br><br>
<b>FELT</b>: A non-woven fabric made by layering thin sheets of fibers, then applying heat, moisture and pressure to shrink and compress the fibers into a thick matted cloth that will not ravel or fray. Often used for appliqué designs and letters.
<br><br>
<b>FINISHING</b>: Processes done after the embroidery is completed, including trimming loose threads, removing excess facing or backing, and pressing or steaming to remove puckers and hoop marks.
<br><br>
<b>LETTERING</b>: An embroidery that uses letters or words. Lettering, commonly called “keyboard lettering,” may be created using an embroidery lettering program on a computer or from circuit boards that allow variance of letter style, size, height, density and other characteristics. This technique is often seen on Augusta baseball and basketball jerseys.
<br><br>
<b>MONOGRAM</b>: An embroidered design composed of one or more letters, usually one’s initials or name.
<br><br>
<b>PUFF EMBROIDERY</b>: The process of stitching a dense motif over embroidery/craft foam to create a three-dimensional effect.
<br><br>
<b>SPECIALTY THREADS</b>: Threads designed for effects such as shine, glitter, iridescence or thickness. The threads are often are made from synthetic materials including rayon, metallic and textured nylon. Mercerized cotton is also often used.
<br><br>
<b>TACKLE TWILL</b>: Letters or numbers cut from Twill fabric that are commonly used for athletic teams and organizations. Tackle Twill Appliqués attach to a garment with an adhesive backing that tacks them in place; the edges of the Appliqués are then zigzag stitched.</p>
