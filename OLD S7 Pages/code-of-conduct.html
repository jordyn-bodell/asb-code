<h2>Supplier Code of Conduct</h2>
</div>

<div class="conduct-container" style="width: 90%; margin: 30px auto; padding-bottom: 40px;">
<p><span class="boldtext">INTRODUCTION</span><br>
Augusta Sportswear, Inc. (collectively with its affiliated entities, “ASI”) strives to achieve and is committed to the highest ethical standards and offering safe, high quality merchandise and wholesale services. ASI expects and requires the same commitment from everyone with whom ASI or its affiliates has commercial dealings (“Suppliers”).
<br><br>
The ASI Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) sets out the requirements expected of our Suppliers regarding compliance with laws and regulations, corruption and bribery, social and working conditions, and protection of the environment. The Code’s standards are based on International Labor Organization standards and internationally accepted good labor practices.
Our goal is to work with our Suppliers to assure full compliance with these requirements as they, in turn, take the responsibility to implement these requirements and necessary due diligence processes with their own employees, agents, temporary workers, subcontractors, suppliers and sub-suppliers with whom they work with in the delivery of goods and services to ASI.
<br><br>
The Code must be visibly posted in English and in the shared language(s) of Supplier’s employees in a common area at all facilities that manufacture products for ASI. Suppliers shall create internal programs for handling reports of workplace grievances, including anonymous reports. The provisions of the Code are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the provisions of any legal agreement or contract between Supplier and ASI. We expect Suppliers to hold their supply chain, including subcontractors and third party labor agencies, to the same standards contained in the Code. The Code does not create any third-party beneficiary rights or benefits for suppliers, subcontractors, their respective employees or any other party.
<br><br>

<span class="boldtext">Reporting Violations:</span> To report suspected violations of this Code of Conduct e-mail <a href="mailto:compliance@augustasportswear.com">Compliance@augustasportswear.com</a>. ASI strictly prohibits any retaliation against persons who report violations of this Code of Conduct or assist or participate in any manner in any investigation of possible violations of this Code of Conduct. Any retaliation should be reported to ASI as outlined above.
<br><br>

<span class="boldtext">LEGAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS</span><br>
Suppliers shall comply with all applicable domestic and international law, regulations, ordinances, industry safety standards, and all other relevant statutory requirements whichever requirements impose the highest standards of conduct. These include, but are not limited to, the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act; the Consumer Product Safety Act; the Child Protection Safety Act of 1969; the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1970 (also known as Proposition 65); the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953; the Federal Hazardous Substances Act; the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act; and such laws related to the importation and labeling of products, packaging, and shipping cartons and containers.
<br><br>

<span class="boldtext">To that end, each Supplier will complete the attached Certificate of Compliance and submit yearly audits conducted by an independent 3rd party Nationally Recognized Test Laboratory, such as UL, TUV, ETL or SGE at Supplier’s sole cost, to ASI or its designated agent in order for ASI to assess and monitor Supplier’s compliance with the Code.</span>
